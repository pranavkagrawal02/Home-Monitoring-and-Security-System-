# Home-Monitoring-and-Security-System-
 Designed a system to enhance home security with a flame sensor to detect fire, an ultrasonic sensor to detect visitors at the front door, and an IR sensor to monitor entry into the house. Additionally, it uses an EM-18 RFID reader module to control access to the front door by scanning RFID cards for authorized entry.
